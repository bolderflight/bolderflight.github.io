        <p class="desc">Bolder Flight Systems was founded to advance aeronautics and autonomy research, technology development, and commercialization. As researchers and engineers, we experienced firsthand the need for high-quality flight control and data acquisition systems. As pilots, we also recognized the potential safety improvements that introducing advanced sensing and data logging into general aviation and flight training could have. We're delighted to make these systems available to you and welcome your feedback to further improve our products.</p>
