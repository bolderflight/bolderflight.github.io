          <h1>Exceptional Value</h1>
          <a name="value"></a> 
          <p>Bring your autonomy technology to market safer and at a fraction of the time and cost. Our innovative integrated avionics backbone is extraordinarily flexible while maintaining low-latency and determinism, enabling your technology to be rapidly and safety integrated on ground, air, and space vehicles.</p>

          <h1>Flexibility and Robustness</h1>
          <a name="flexibility"></a> 
          <p>Our core technology is an innovative, tightly integrated bus topology, configuration overlay system, and scheduler. These key components enable our integrated avionics backbone to support an unlimited number of sensors, actuators, and processors. Our system rapidly configures timing-critical sensing, estimation, and control algorithms and includes a flexible messaging interface with language-neutral API's for integrating payloads and higher-level autonomy control loops. A fixed time delay between sensing and actuation is maintained, which enables analysis of system robustness to uncertainties and external disturbances. This feature is critical to ensuring that your autonomous system will operate safely and reliably. This combination of flexibility and robustness is unique to our integrated avionics backbone.</p>
