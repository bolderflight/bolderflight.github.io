          <h3>CTO</h3>
          <p>Chris Regan has extensive technical experience and strong business acumen. Chris is Director of the University of Minnesota UAS Research Labs and a PhD candidate researching robust control in the presence of state limitations. Chris has extensive experience in experiment design, vehicle modeling, and controls. He recently developed an innovative simulation capability at the University enabling rapid transition from vehicle concept through simlation and flight validation. The system was developed for users ranging from graduate students implementing their first control law to seasoned researchers seeking a quick and easy platform to test new methods. As an instructor in the Aerospace Engineering Department, Chris teaches two courses in design with an emphasis on systems engineering, fundamental engineering practice, and validation. Previously, Chris was a researcher at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. He was the lead flight control engineer for the X-56A project during its formulation and design phase. He was the NASA Chief Engineer for the X-48B aircraft from 2008 to 2012. For the X-48B program Chris developed and implemented an in-flight stability estimation system that was used throughout the flight test program.</p>
