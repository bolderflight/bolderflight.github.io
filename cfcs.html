          <h1>Common Flight Control System (C-FCS)</h1>
          <!-- <a name="value"></a> --> 
          <br>
          <p>We are developing C-FCS for safe control of aircraft ranging from small hand-launched unmanned aircraft to 
            large, manned aircraft by leveraging the capability of plug-and-play sensors, processors, and actuators. A common 
            system allows for standardization across a fleet of varying types of aircraft which reduces training, maintenance, 
            logistics and upgrade costs. C-FCS can also facilitate interoperability between various aircraft, assist with research 
            efforts, and help to streamline the airworthiness certification process.

          <h1>Functionality</h1>
          <br>
          <p>C-FCS works by flexibly integrating sensors, actuators, and processors on a common network, enabling configuring 
            the system for a wide variety of different vehicles. Redundant sensors, actuators, and processors can be added to 
            provide redundancy for safety-critical and manned vehicles. Fault tolerant control software maximally utilizes the 
            system redundancy, autonomously detecting faults and modifying control laws, to enable the vehicle to safely continue 
            flight. A cascaded flight control system supports multiple modes of operation: <span class="highlight">fully-autonomous, 
            remotely-piloted, and piloted.</span> Handling qualities are evaluated to ensure safe vehicle operation, even in degraded vehicle states</p>

          <h1>Air Force Partnership</h1>
          <br>
          <p>We were awarded an AFWERX, Agility Prime Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) fall 2020 for further 
              improvement and customer exploration. Our partners include Pennsylvania State University (PSU), Systems Technology Inc (STI) 
              and Beta Technologies. PSU bring expertise in the areas of autonomous fault-detection and reconfiguration, STI brings expertise 
              in control law design and handling qualities analysis, and Beta Technologies brings unique feedback as a potential customer and 
              developer of a manned eVTOL vehicle. Together we are creating a fault-tolerant, plug-and-play common flight control system.
              <br> 
              <br>
              We would love to discuss potential partnerships with you for Phase II development in 2021 and beyond. <span class="highlight">Please <a href="index.html#contact">contact</a> us today!</span>
